Hi, this repository is for homework assignment 15.  The website deployed is an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity Data Set, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.  The dashboard contains a table, a bar chart, a bubble chart to display information for an ID selected from the main page drop-down menu.

Thanks for stopping by - Terri
